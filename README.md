# MultiSDCardWriter
Script to write to more than 1 sd card at a time - very handy when trying to write multiple Raspberry Pi images in preparation for tutorials

## Usage
`python writecards.py [image-to-copy]`

You will be asked to confirm that the number of SD card readers and number of SD cards is correct. If they are then the script will continue to write the image to all the SD cards simultanously.
